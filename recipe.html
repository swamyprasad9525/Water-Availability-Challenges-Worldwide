        <h2>Panner Paratha</h2>
        <b><ol>
            <li>Take whole wheat flour or atta in a bowl. Pour a small quantity of water and knead. Keep adding water as desired and knead smooth, soft dough. Let it rest for 20 			minutes.</li>
	    <li>Prepare the stuffing by grating paneer into small particles. Add finely chopped green chillies, coriander, onion, and spices. Mix everything well and keep aside.</li>
            <li>Take a small portion of the dough and roll it out roughly. Place a spoonful of the paneer filling in the centre and seal it from all sides. Flatten and roll out again. Use       	        dry flour as required during the process. Make as many parathas as you need with this process.</li>
	    <li>Once you get a half-inch thick paratha, heat the tawa. Transfer the paratha onto the tawa and let it cook on one side. Meanwhile, apply ghee or oil on the other   	  	        side.</li>
            <li>Flip it and cook on the other side. Press gently with a spatula so that it roasts properly. Apply some more ghee on the top side before flipping again.</li>
	    <li>Once the paratha is cooked properly on both sides and turns brown, take it off the flame. Serve with dahi, chutney or pickle of choice!</li>
